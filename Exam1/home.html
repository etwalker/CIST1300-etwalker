<p> <b> We just opened our doors in 2020! Emily's Doggy Day Care is the go-to social spot for your fur babies for a fun and exciting day 
of playtime with other dogs. </p> <br> 

<p> We have a 3000-square-foot facility that can accommodate both puppies and adult dogs with both indoor and outdoor facilities.
 We take pride in letting the dogs under our care roam free to their hearts' content.</p> <br>

<p> We don't confine your furry friend to a kennel or a a dog run. Your fur babies can go in and out of our outdoor area whenever he 
wants while being constantly monitored by our dedicated trained staff. </p>
