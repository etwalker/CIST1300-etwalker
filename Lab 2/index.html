<p> Welcome to CIST1300 </p>

<p> Since I do not know web design, I do not know how to make the class more interesting. 
I feel like I need more practice with web design. I need more hands on experience. Right now I do not know how to 
view my web page using GitPro. I will get better with more practice. </p>

using a new paragraph tag. </p>
