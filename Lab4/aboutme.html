<address> University of Nebraska <br>6001 Dodge Street <br> Omaha, NE 68182 <br> Phone: (402) 403-7887 </address>
<p> <b> I am a student at the University of Nebraska, Omaha (UNO). I am a non-traditional student. Non-traditional students are 
usually 24 and older. As slightly older young adults, many students who attend college at this age have work experience or family 
situations that can sometimes make attending college full-time difficult. A college education has always been important to me, but working to support myself has always been a priority. 
And, I strated a family at the age of 25 and raising my children became my priority. I took my first college course at the age of 17, graducated with my Associates Degree at age 29, and just a few months later began my undergrad studies towards
my Bachelors degree. At UNO, I will be completing my studies and graduating in December 2020 with my Bachelors degree at age 44. <br> <br>

 My degree is in Environmental Studies: Geography and Planning. My work experience will make me a strong canidate for hire, in addition to my Bachelors degree, and internship
that I will be doing over the summer. I am seeking an internship as an Environmental Project Manager with either Kiewet or HDR. My past work experience has been focused 
in business management including working with government agencies, maintaining files and detailed records, working with confidential infomation, and  planning and overseeing small 
projects to ensure they are completed in a timely fashion and within budget.
