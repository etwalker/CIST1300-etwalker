<p> <b>Yoga has changed my life and made me a better person.  I’ve laughed and cried doing yoga and its my go-to, my foundation, 
my center of gravity — my sanity. I couldn’t imagine my life without it, and am at a loss as to why not everyone shares my excitement. 
Yet. I admit it’s easy for life to take over. Daily errands, work, kids, pets, and a million other obligations. I remember feeling uncomfortable attending 
my first and  had a bad experience when I tried yoga several years ago — a yoga teacher can make or break your yoga experience. 
 Bad first experiences are hard to make up for and taking that first step is never easy. Yoga practice will leave you feeling rejuvenated, refreshed, relaxed, and just plain awesome. 
 It will allow you to find your Zen moment wherever, whenever.<p/>

<p> I have been following Ashley Horner on Facebook and have been a part of her private group for years. I finallly purchasaed one of her training training programs 
4 weeks ago called "Recreating You" and I have not been diappointed.  She has 14 (e-book) trainers that are easy to follow and come with a meal plan. 
I’ve used her plans as a guide for my meal plan and workouts in the gym. <br> <br> "Recreating You" is a  12 week trainer geared toward building strength and and beginning your fitness jouney. This trainer is designed for 
people that cannot get to the gym or feel most comfortable starting to work out at home. However, I prefer to do my workouts at the gym. The program is built on 4 phases, with each 
phase  increasing in your strength and endurance, but trust me when I say this, it will be like no other program you have ever done! She will push you, but you will feel powerful 
and accomplish things you never thought you could!  The meal plan is easy to follow and includes TONS of recipes. I personally used it as a guide rather than following it precisely,
but for those who like to be told exactly what to eat this is great for you! It really teaches  you about 
nutrition and how to pair it with your activity. <p/>

<p> <b>These are my three loving dogs. Abby is the black and white Boston Terrier,
Nova is the fawn colored Boxer-Pitbull, and Lucci is the tan and white American Pitbull. 
I love spending time with my dogs and taking them on long walks and runs when the weather is 
nice. Dogs are the best because, unlike people (and most cats), they 
love you unconditionally. Owning a dog can help kids learn about responsibility and empathy. 
They love to snuggle and they're the best at it. <br><br>
One of the reasons why dogs make good pets is because they help with loneliness. Dogs love 
being around their owners and love to please them. You'll always have your dog to cuddle with, 
eat dinner with, or head to a dog-friendly park. You'll discover quickly that your dog will become 
your most loyal friend.<p/>
